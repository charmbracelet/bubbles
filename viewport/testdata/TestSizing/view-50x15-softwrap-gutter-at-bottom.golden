│  Precept Thirteen: 'Never Be Afraid'. Fear can │
│  only hold you back. Facing your fears can be a│
│   tremendous effort. Therefore, you should just│
│   not be afraid in the first place.            │
│  Precept Fourteen: 'Respect Your Superiors'. If│
│   someone is your superior in strength or intel│
│  lect or both, you need to show them your respe│
│  ct. Don't ignore them or laugh at them.       │
│  Precept Fifteen: 'One Foe, One Blow'. You shou│
│  ld only use a single blow to defeat an enemy. │
│  Any more is a waste. Also, by counting your bl│
│  ows as you fight, you'll know how many foes yo│
│  u've defeated.                                │
