│Precept Thirteen: 'Never Be Afraid'. Fear can on│
│ly hold you back. Facing your fears can be a tre│
│mendous effort. Therefore, you should just not b│
│e afraid in the first place.                    │
│Precept Fourteen: 'Respect Your Superiors'. If s│
│omeone is your superior in strength or intellect│
│ or both, you need to show them your respect. Do│
│n't ignore them or laugh at them.               │
│Precept Fifteen: 'One Foe, One Blow'. You should│
│ only use a single blow to defeat an enemy. Any │
│more is a waste. Also, by counting your blows as│
│ you fight, you'll know how many foes you've def│
│eated.                                          │
